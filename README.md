# exploring-supervised-learning
In this article I'm going to present the results of using 4 different algorithms for classification tasks: logistic regression, decision trees, k nearest neighbors, and neural networks. In order to do this I'll use Red wine quality dataset. Also, I use sklearn to implement each of the algorithms.
